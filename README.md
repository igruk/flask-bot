When the "Registration" button is pressed, the user is redirected to the Telegram bot created using the Aiogram library.

Telegram bot implements user registration by requesting necessary data.

After registration, users can log in to their account page on the website.

The user's account page displays all available information about their Telegram account (name, username, profile picture).

User can also delete their account.
