When the "Registration" button is pressed, user is redirected to Telegram bot created using the aiogram library.
 
Telegram bot implements user registration by requesting necessary data.

After registration, user can log in to their account page on the website.

User's account page displays all available information about their Telegram account (name, username, profile picture).

User can also delete their account.
