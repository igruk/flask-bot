When the "Registration" button is pressed, the user is redirected to a Telegram bot created using the aiogram library.
 
The Telegram bot implements user registration by requesting necessary data.

After registration, the user can log in to their account page on the website.

The user's account page displays all available information about their Telegram account (name, username, profile picture).

The user can also delete their account.
